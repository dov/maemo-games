# Commentary

There are 5 pentamino tiles, made up of 5 connected squares. These may be used to tile the plane. Gento is a gtk implementation of the pentamino game. The player is presented with a 5x4, 5x5, up to 5x12 board and with the corresponding number of pentamino tiles. Move these around with the stylus or the keyboard, and use [R] to rotate, [F] to flip, and [N] for a new game.
